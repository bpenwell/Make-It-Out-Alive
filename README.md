A message from the developers,

Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmares!!! Just kidding, this isn't scary at all. But it is a pretty hard Polygon Dash spin-off.
Narrowly dodge spike traps, spinning blades and swinging axes, all while not running out of stamina or leaving the screen area...

Good luck.
